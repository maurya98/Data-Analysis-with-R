I accrued some medical debt within the last two years.  <br><br>I used my credit cards to cover the medical expenses my insurance didn't cover.  I am in excellent condition now.  I am slightly surprised about the score Transunion gave me.  I have been running my three credit reports and scores monthly through Experian for the last year and my score always averages 725 - 739 for all three Credit Reporting Agencies.  When checking my credit report directly through Transunion, my score was lower.  <br><br>I am in the process of consolidating my student loans.  The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.  The student  loan payment is $161 per month and in good standing.  Consolidating the installments/loans will increase my credit score by approximately 15 points. <br>"	credit_card	Credit Card Consolidation	941xx	CA	21.01	0	May-92	2	39		14	0	21366	44.9	18	f	0	0	12159.38	12159.38	9800	2359.38	0	0	0	Jan-14	3866		Jan-16	0		1	INDIVIDUAL	0

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems. It is also worth noting that I share my condo, so mortgage and bills are split, giving me a comfortable buffer in my disposable income to cover payments on this loan without any adverse affects.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br>"	major_purchase	Loan Payoff and Home Improvement	112xx	NY	2.21	0	May-06	2			9	0	2217	18.8	13	f	0	0	15808.02	15808.02	14050	1758.02	0	0	0	Dec-13	5569.67		Dec-13	0		1	INDIVIDUAL	0

Please let me say I believe I am a safe investment.  I make all my bill payments on time and have been trying to focus on chipping away at me debt and came across Lending Club.

Which is understandable. but impersonnal..  I am responsible and make all my payments as I mentioned above.  I have had a lot of unforseen expensed come my way and had to use credit cards.

Recently in a car accident which the responsible party is contesting, even though there were broken bones.  I am paying money out which may be reimbuseable later, but am not counting on it.  Therefore, I am consolidatiing so that I don't get behind in bill payments.  Just looking to the future to pay off loans, increase credit score, and looking to by a house in the near future.  Do not want smaller bills to hinder my credit rating and continue paying cash for doctors bills.  Do not want to get behind on any payments.  Income is good, but out going cash wasn't expected and car repairs of $4,000 outgoing which I believe is better than new car payments.  I paid my last Lending Club loan almost a year early due to my financial standing at the time and am committed to paying this loan in full.  Thank you!!<br> Borrower added on 12/08/11 > Sorry for the miss spelled words. I updated without proofing my information.

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!"""	debt_consolidation	Consolidation	641xx	MO	4.96	0	Dec-95	3			6	0	10984	84.5	9	f	0	0	18462.04001	18426.58	13000	5462.04	0	0	0	Apr-15	5992.22		Jan-16	0		1	INDIVIDUAL	0

I am also currently serving in the Army National Guard as an Executive Officer at the rank of 1st Lieutenant. I have honorably served for 7 years thus far. I do plan to serve another 13 years to complete a full 20 year military career.  I plan to use the funds to consolidate credit card debt and low balance fixed payment debts. My job is very stable as the financial services industry is in high demand of risk and compliance professionals in lieu of the numerous regulations imposed on the industry. And if needed, I always have the option of working full-time for the Army National Guard if for some reason my civilian job was no longer present. I will have no issues repaying this loan. After factoring in the monthly payment amount into my monthly budget, and I will have no issues meeting my monthly obligations.  Also, being a member of the U.S military, especially an officer, the Army will not allow any of my debts to go into a delinquency status. The military will garnish my wages and provide them to creditors until the debts are paid, which can be seen as a little extra security in terms of repayment.  I am a responsible individual and if given the opportunity, would like to be able to put myself in a better financial standing. Thank you for taking the time to read my post and have a wonderful day.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.

This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground. Thank you so much for considering our loan<br> Borrower added on 12/08/11 > We would also like to open the kitchen up and serve appetizers and snacks. There is a full kitchen, with no equipment.

Five years ago, my credit <br><br>score was very poor.  It's currently plenty good enough for my listing to be accepted.

I can tell you the <br><br>remaining balances on all my debts, when payment on them is due, and the minimums required.  <br><br>I'm comfortable in the $650.00 payment range.

I received a loan through lending club back in May to help with one part of my debt consolidation plan.  As I have moved forward some teaser rates have expired on my cards and interest rates are really bogging me down in trying to get ahead on the revolving debt.<br><br>I, like many others have had some big expenses (unforseen), and took advantage of some teaser rates to try and get ahead.  I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).  Also, I have cut up the cards and have reverted to a strict budget with a &quot;cash&quot; only philosophy.  <br><br>Thank You again for your time and consideration!<br> Borrower added on 11/26/11 > Additional information...I have a 1900 month mortgage (waiting for HARP 2 for a possible refinance), 400 a month car payment, plus the revolving and utilities.  Consolidating this will give me the peace of mind of having a fixed amount over a fixed period.  <br>"	debt_consolidation	Debt Consolidation 2	282xx	NC	23.7	0	Apr-96	3			16	0	61575	57.1	40	f	0	0	21096.39248	20955.83	15000	6096.39	0	0	0	Jun-15	6203.71		Jun-15	0		1	INDIVIDUAL	0

I made a mistake in having too many credit cards and I simply do not wish to go down that route again. With the situation of banks right now, they do not want to lend a large dollar amount to anyone regardless of credit history. I have always kept above a 720 credit score for as long as I have had credit history. More recently it has come down slightly, not because I have been late or anything, but because my balances are high. I ALWAYS pay my bills on time and have NEVER had any late or delinquent payments. I am a worthy borrower not only because of my credit history, but because I also believe that if you spend it, you must pay it back. I personally do not believe in not paying my bills. I have a full time VERY stable job and make decent money, the minimum payment on this loan is actually less than my minimum payments per month on all of my current credit cards, so there is no problem in you getting your investment back plus interest. I regard my credit scores very highly and I would not jepordize my credit history because I just decided I did not want to pay for things I purchased, that is quite immoral. I would simply like to have one payment and close out all the little cards so I can have a little piece of mind.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated.

I have had one bad account which was a student loan which I defaulted on due to circumstances beyond my controll; however once I knew about the default status I paid the loan in full and it is the only negative on my credit report. I work very hard to make on time payments and keep my accounts in good standing. I have been employed full time at my current employer for 3 years. The only reason I had to find this job was due to corporate cut backs and let go's. I was low man on the totem pole with only 2 years tenure and eventually was let go. I was employed by my current employer within 1 week of being let go and I have not looked back since. My current employer is a close group of people and this is my new home until I retire.<br><br>	house	Getting On Track	853xx	AZ	11.5	0	Apr-05	0	42		8	0	5579	33	15	f	0	0	12784.13	12784.13	12100	684.13	0	0	0	Apr-12	11880.82		Mar-15	0		1	INDIVIDUAL	0

While I clock in my 50-60 hours per week so that I can someday also offer loans here to other people, I just want consolidate my credit cards for 2 simple reasons: <br><br>1) to get everything under a fixed rate-- I don't trust the giant corporate lenders I owe money to or the whole idea of a &quot;variable&quot; rate anymore, with or without Dodd-Frank. <br><br>2) The tax payer bailed out the financial system. It occured to me that I would much rather pay interest to other human beings seeking an honest return on investment rather than giant banks whose reputations are currently tarnished for dishonesty and greed. <br><br>Fund my loan so I can cancel and cut up some credit cards, you earn interest--not Citigroup, Chase, or Amex!

The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which I?m able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.

Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs. I pay all my bills on time and usually try to pay more than required. As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.

An allowance of 5-10% overage has been built into budget. These projects will significantly add to home value. The property in question is a two-family home in a prime real estate location where values have not fallen by any significant degree. I currently live on the second floor and have a long-term, reliable tenant on the first floor. My aim is to bring the house up to its full potential through these projects and then keep the property indefinitely. Funds from the loan will also free up existing cash on hand, which will be used to eliminate other existing credit balances. I am self-employed as a freelance translator and over the course of eight years of experience in my current role I have never had any shortage of work; because of my position as a B2B service provider for critical sectors such as heavy industry, pharmaceutical, and IT, demand is diversified and constant. I have top professional ratings and excellent credit history, and have secured quality professionals to undertake the project at hand at a fair price.
